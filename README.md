# React Docker AWS CI/CD Workflow

This repository demonstrates a **production-grade CI/CD workflow** utilizing **Docker** for containerization, **Travis CI** for continuous integration, and **AWS Elastic Beanstalk** for deployment.

The React application is kept intentionally simple, consisting only of the default React opening page. This allows us to focus solely on understanding the complete workflow of a production-grade CI/CD pipeline.

## Key Technologies Used:
- **React**: A simple front-end web application.
- **Docker**: Used to containerize the application for consistent development and production environments.
- **Travis CI**: Handles automated testing and deployment in a continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline.
- **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**: Deploys the containerized React app for production use.

## Purpose:
By keeping the React application simple, we avoid spending time on UI development. Instead, this project emphasizes the workflow and infrastructure behind building, testing, and deploying a React application using Docker and AWS services.
